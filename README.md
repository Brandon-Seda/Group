# Groupd
I am working to create a website where gamers who usually have trouble finding others to play games they like can find or create a group with hopes of meeting others. 
Initially it will start with more well known games and expand on from there. 

## Basic Structure

- User create account
- User selects games which they play
- User selects rank for competitive games
- User creates a group or selects to join a group
- Once group is filled and all players select ready usernames of players are sent to host to be added. 
- Let the games begin! 


## Technologies in mind
- React
- Node.JS
- Express
- MongoDB
- Firebase
